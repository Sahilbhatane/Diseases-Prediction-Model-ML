<h4>A data mining application to predict disease using symptom data i.e. <strong>Prognosis</strong>. To develop this application, we used the <strong>Columbia University dataset</strong> and build a model using both Multinomial Naive-Bayes and Decision Tree Algorithm to predict the disease given the symptoms observed in a person.</h4>

-----------------------------------------
### Columbia University Dataset
 
* This dataset is a knowledge database of disease-symptom associations generated by an automated method based on information in textual discharge summaries of patients at New York-Presbyterian Hospital admitted during 2004. The dataset can be found [here](http://people.dbmi.columbia.edu/~friedma/Projects/DiseaseSymptomKB/index.html).

* The first column shows the disease, the second the number of discharge summaries containing a positive and current mention of the disease, and the associated symptom.

------------------------------------------
### Tasks performed

- `Data extraction and cleaning` :  Basic cleaning, segmentation of columns and string formatting were performed in Excel. 
- `Data preprocessing` : Data preprocessing tasks performed include:
  * Spelling mistakes in the names of diseases or symptoms or their codes was rectified
  * The codes which were given to diseases and symptoms were removed as they were irrelevant for our task
  * A cumulative list of all symptoms was made 
  * Each symptom was assigned a Boolean value of 0 or 1 for each disease, according to whether the symptom occurs with the disease or not
- `Data visualization` : Built correlation heatmaps for relationship between the symptoms and relationship between the diseases
- `Model Building` : Used 2 algorithms for this dataset and compared the results to evaluate which one yielded better results: *Multinomial Naive Bayes Classifier* and *Decision Tree*.

Find the detailed documentation [here](./Disease_Prediction_from_Symptoms.pdf).

### Results

The results of all the tasks can be viewed by running [this](./Disease_Prediction_from_Symptoms.ipynb) code in Google Collab or in the detailed documentation above. 

The entire decision tree is too big to be inserted here, so only a part of it is shown here. The entire decision tree can be found [here](./Images/decision-tree-full.png).
